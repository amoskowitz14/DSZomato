I would say it was unique.\\\\nTried nachos, pasta churros and lasagne.\\\\n\\\\nNachos were pathetic.( Seriously don\\'t order)\\\\nPasta was okayish.\\\\nLasagne was good.\\\\nNutella churros were the best.\\\\nOverall an okayish experience!\\\\nPeace ??\"), (\\'Rated 4.0\\', \"RATED\\\\n  First of all, a big thanks to the staff of this Cafe. Very polite and courteous.\\\\n\\\\nI was there 15mins before their closing time. Without any discomfort or hesitation, the staff welcomed me with a warm smile and said they\\'re still open, though they were preparing to close the cafe for the day.\\\\n\\\\nQuickly ordered the Thai green curry, which is served with rice. They got it for me within 10mins, hot and freshly made.\\\\n\\\\nIt was tasty with the taste of coconut milk. Not very spicy, it was mild spicy.\\\\n\\\\nI saw they had yummy looking dessert menu, should go there to try them out!\\\\n\\\\nA good spacious place to hang out for coffee, pastas, pizza or Thai food.\"), (\\'Rated 3.0\\', \"RATED\\\\n  A place for people who love churos.

The quality has gone down drastically. Food quality has become very average from good. Service is also very bad of late.\\'), (\\'Rated 1.0\\', \\'RATED\\\\n  Really disappointed with the place.\\\\n\\\\nSeems like a old dusty store room stacked up with old sofas and chairs!

The ambience was last cleaned a decade back i guess. A cockroach just walked over our table. As it was alive, and well moving , the bakasura couldnt take a pic of it. Then the staff had to actually take it out of our table. Such ambience ? like what are you upto?\\\\n\\\\nBakasura disapproves. I dont even want to talk about the food.\"), (\\'Rated 4.0\\', \\'RATED\\\\n  A nice place to hangout, this place looks professional and also cute.

Was really tempted to try their Churros but we were stuffed. Worth a visit and try for sure!\\'), (\\'Rated 3.0\\', \"RATED\\\\n  Churros, the restaurant\\'s eponymous offering, has to be tried. They\\'re a Mexican snack and served with chocolate sauce. Milkshakes are good too. The interior walls have murals and writings all over.

The ambience was pretty good. We ordered two \\'churros for two\\'. Having churros for the first time ever, I was way too excited and judgmental. But swear to Lord, the churros were heavenly! The chocolate sauce was the actual chocolate sauce and not nutella xD We had taken the Cross Country Ranch pizza. It was a thin crust pizza loaded with veggies.\\\\nThe place is famous for churros (the name suggests so). I would love to visit again to try all the other items out :\\')\"), (\\'Rated 4.0\\', \\'RATED\\\\n  I love the desserts more than anything here !Good place and well served !:)\\\\nWe dint like the nachos here , it was not that good as we expected !\\\\nExcept nachos almost all dish were quite good!\\'), (\\'Rated 2.0\\', \"RATED\\\\n  2nd time I have visited this place and I am surprised to see how it has declined. Churros was hard, pizza was pathetic, loaded nachos and masala Garlic bread were topped with cheese with MAYO! Yes mayonnese.. Soup has the bread crumbs in almost melted state, mocktails were average and our only Savior was pasta and caramel pudding... This place has high potential but let down by dull ambience, pretty slow and inattentive staff. Buffet price was listed as 399 but was charged 499, We still went ahead and took the deal to be very disappointed!! Most dishes were freshly cooked hence going with some starts else would rate them lower. I did not find a single person who seemed happy with their meal as moat complained about one thing or the other. That\\'ll be my last visit San Churros.\")]'"
